=======================

### Chapter 01 Bayes' Therorem

    P(H|D) = P(H)P(D|H)/P(D)

* P(H) is the probability of the hypothesis before we see the data, called the prior probability, or just **prior**.
* P(H|D) is what we want to compute, the probability of the hypothesis after we see the data, called the **posterior**.
* P(D|H) is the probability of the data under the hypothesis, called the **likelihood**.
* P(D) is the probability of the data under any hypothesis, called the **normalizing constant**.
