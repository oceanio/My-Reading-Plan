Notes on “Machine Learning in Action”
===========================

### Chapter 01 Machine Learning basics

>   I keep saying the sexy job in the next ten years will be statisticians. People think I’m
    joking, but who would’ve guessed that computer engineers would’ve been the sexy job of
    the 1990s? The ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract
    value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important
    skill in the next decades, not only at the professional level but even at the educational
    level for elementary school kids, for high school kids, for college kids. Because now we
    really do have essentially free and ubiquitous data. So the complementary scarce factor is
    the ability to understand that data and extract value from it. I think statisticians are
    part of it, but it’s just a part. You also want to be able to visualize the data,
    communicate the data, and utilize it effectively. But I do think those skills—of being
    able to access, understand, and communicate the insights you get from data analysis—
    are going to be extremely important. Managers need to be able to access and understand
    the data themselves.
